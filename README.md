## üöÄ Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Link Risk Scoring**  
  Uses structural signals (e.g., presence of contact info, privacy policy, HTTPS usage) to generate a security risk score.

- üåê **Live Web Crawling**  
  Automatically visits and extracts content from the provided URL, even when traditional metadata is lacking.

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Content Analysis**  
  Leverages generative AI to evaluate the extracted content, red flags, and tone of the page to assess if it's potentially deceptive.

- üîç **Search-Enhanced Contextual Intelligence**  
  Performs parallel real-time searches using platforms like **Google**, **Reddit**, **X (formerly Twitter)**, **Meta**, and **YouTube** to find social signals, user reports, and discussions that might indicate malicious behavior.

- üìä **Human-Readable Report**  
  Returns a Markdown-formatted summary explaining:
    - Detected risks and red flags
    - Confidence level
    - Advice on what to look out for

## üß† How It Works

1. **Input Query or Link**  
   The user provides a product link or a keyword (e.g., `"XYZ Crypto Investment"`).

2. **Website Crawling & Feature Extraction**  
   The system fetches the webpage, checks for key indicators like:
    - Contact information
    - Social media links
    - HTTPS usage
    - Presence of privacy policy
    - Use of sensitive forms

3. **Heuristic Scoring**  
   A score is calculated based on presence/absence of trustworthy site elements.

4. **Contextual Search**  
   Searches across multiple sources for user complaints or scam reports.

5. **AI Analysis**  
   Combines the website content, search results, and security score to generate a clear risk assessment using large language models.
